# Digital-System-Course-Codes-and-Reports
这是刘杰的数字系统原理课程的一堆实验课及其报告, 经过这个课, 什么面包板/二极管/都别叫/这是你自己写的吗 之类的都成为了班上莫名其妙的梗, 作为某种纪念留在此处.
This is a bunch of experimental classes and their reports from Liu Jie's Digital System course. After this class, topics such as breadboards, diodes, don't call them anything, were all inexplicable memes in the class. As a kind of commemoration, they are left here.
